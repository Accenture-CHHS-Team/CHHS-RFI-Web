# CALParent API

##

##REQUIREMENTS

The API server requires API tokens from Socrata (to access the CALHHS facilities API) and the Texas A&M geocoding service (to geocode user addresses).
To obtain a Socrata API token, visit [https://chhs.data.ca.gov/login]
To obtain a TAMU API token, visit [https://geoservices.tamu.edu/Login/]

A&M geocoding provides a significant number of API usage credits upon creating a user ID, but large-scale, sustained usage may incur charges, just in 
case you want to continue using the API on other projects.
